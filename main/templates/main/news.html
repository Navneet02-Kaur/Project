                <h2>New Carbon Policies Introduced</h2>
                <p>Governments worldwide are tightening regulations on carbon emissions to accelerate climate action. Recent policies focus on stricter emission caps, incentives for green energy adoption, and penalties for industries exceeding carbon limits. The EU has expanded its Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), while the US is pushing new tax credits for carbon capture projects. Developing nations are also introducing carbon pricing models to drive sustainable growth. These policies aim to balance economic growth with environmental responsibility, ensuring a cleaner future.</p>
